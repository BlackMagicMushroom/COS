## Software Included

* VICE, the main attraction. This is the open source C64 emulator for Linux. To play C64 images, look for the roms in `/usr/share/classic/c64`
* VirtualBox, the PC emulation software. If you wish to try your custom Linux Mint ISO, this emulator will run it with network access.
* VisualBoyAdvance, to play your favorite GBA, GBC, or GB roms. 
* Chromium, the main web browser. This is an open source clone of the famous Google Chrome browser. It offers the same plugins plus the dinosaur game.
* Wine, the Windows Environment layer for Linux. Not every Windows program works here but Halo certainly works flawlessly.
* FreeDOOM, the open source DOOM game from DOS with a new story. WADs included.
* VLC, the media player. If Windows 10 won't let you watch movies, VLC offers high quality playback and streaming.
* Stella, the Atari 2600 emulator.
* ioQuake3, the open source Quake III Arena game for Linux.
* GNU Paint, the paint program similar to Windows MS Paint.
* kdeNLive, the video editing software for Linux. This can export media files to the format you need and however you want.
* FileZilla, the File Transfer Protocol maintenance tool for Linux.
* ESpeak, a text-to-speech program for Linux. Make it say whatever you want because you obviously do not have the guts to say it yourself.
* Audacity, the audio tool for Linux. Edit and export as lossless audio or midi.
* Steam, the Steam launcher tool for Linux. Requires internet access.
* LibreOffice, the free Office Suite everybody dreams of having.
* Desktop Cube, just to spicen up some things.
