# Commodore OS Vision II Official Site

Welcome to Commodore OS Vision II. This is a remaster and minimal system of Barry Altman's COS Vision from 2012. This OS will be built entirely using Linux Mint 18.3 Live CDs. To learn how to make your own Linux Mint distro and customize it to the core, seek <a href="https://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/1784">here</a>.

## Software Included

* VICE, the main attraction. This is the open source C64 emulator for Linux. To play C64 images, look for the roms in `/usr/share/classic/c64`
* VirtualBox, the PC emulation software. If you wish to try your custom Linux Mint ISO, this emulator will run it with network access.
* VisualBoyAdvance, to play your favorite GBA, GBC, or GB roms. 
* Chromium, the main web browser. This is an open source clone of the famous Google Chrome browser. It offers the same plugins plus the dinosaur game.
* Wine, the Windows Environment layer for Linux. Not every Windows program works here but Halo certainly works flawlessly.
* FreeDOOM, the open source DOOM game from DOS with a new story. WADs included.
* VLC, the media player. If Windows 10 won't let you watch movies, VLC offers high quality playback and streaming.
* Stella, the Atari 2600 emulator.
* ioQuake3, the open source Quake III Arena game for Linux.
* GNU Paint, the paint program similar to Windows MS Paint.
* kdeNLive, the video editing software for Linux. This can export media files to the format you need and however you want.
* FileZilla, the File Transfer Protocol maintenance tool for Linux.
* ESpeak, a text-to-speech program for Linux. Make it say whatever you want because you obviously do not have the guts to say it yourself.
* Audacity, the audio tool for Linux. Edit and export as lossless audio or midi.
* Steam, the Steam launcher tool for Linux. Requires internet access.
* LibreOffice, the free Office Suite everybody dreams of having.
* Desktop Cube, just to spicen up some things.
* `genisoimage` and `squashfs-tools`, to make that custom Linux Mint ISO.
